Therefore, the wise observe things beyond the material, contemplate their eternal selves, and prefer temporary loneliness over eternal desolation.",

If the chaste wife lets down her guard after her gray hairs have begun to show, The purity and work of half a life together come to naught.

      "man_en2ggl_cn": "歌舞姑娘晚年若能遇上良人，前世的胭脂花都不是障碍。如果贞洁的妻子在白发开始显现后放松警惕，半生的纯洁和努力就化为泡影。俗话说：“看人的一生，只看后半生。”这真是至理名言。",
      "man_en2gpt_cn": "若年老时歌舞女遇良人，往昔的红尘花事，皆不是阻碍。若贞妻晚年放松警惕，半生的清廉辛苦，尽皆成空。俗语说：“看人一生，只看后半辈。” 此言着实有理。"

Leave the fighting over name and wealth to others, But do not despise their intoxication with such things. Your own disinterestedness is appropriate for you, But do not take pride in thinking that you alone are enlightened.

One may lack the obsession with rocks and springs but is often intoxicated with wine and engrossed in poetry. Competing and listening to others, yet not humbly and completely drunk.

Being of high rank but not loving the people— This is a thief wearing ceremonial robes. Lecturing on learned subjects but not giving proper respect to putting them into action— This is Zen of the mouth alone. Performing great achievements but giving no thought to the seeds of virtue for the future— This is only flowers blooming and withering right before your eyes.",

      "ori_cn2gpt_en": "Reading without learning from sages makes one a mere copyist; serving as an official without loving the people makes one a clothed thief; teaching without practicing makes one a talker of empty words; establishing a career without nurturing virtue makes one bloom only for the moment.",
